# vector-face-recognition
This Repo contains the code used for recognizing faces.
it will not work or be of any use except for reviewing as there needs to be a lot of dependencies and software installed in order for the code to excute.
(beside having the physical robot in hands as well)

* PS: code is a mix of pre-implemented and edited/modified code
